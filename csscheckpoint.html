After opening its doors for the first time in a coworking space, GOMYCODE won the BlooMMasters program in MIT (in 2017) and opened its first hackerspace in Tunis before expanding to Sousse, Sfax, Nabeul, El Menzah V, Beja, Gafsa and Gabes.
    
    During its initial 3 years, GOMYCODE trained more than 10 000 students and set up associations with no less than 100 partners among private and public organizations, colleges and non-administrative associations.
    
    In 2020, GOMYCODE is thinking big and starting its first activities outside of Tunisia. Notably in Algeria, France, Morocco, Egypt, Bahrain, Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire.</p>
